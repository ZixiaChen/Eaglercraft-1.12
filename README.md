# Eaglercraft 1.12 javascript runtime

Dev branch for the Eagler 1.12 javascript runtime. This is still incomplete and does not even compile. 

### Development roadmap
1) Rewriting Lax1dude's 1.8 code to work with 1.12 and rewriting 1.12 to work with Lax1dude's code - Complete
2) Removing native Java libraries and rewriting 1.12 to use Eaglercraft dependencies, as well as upgrading said dependencies to the versions used by 1.12 - In progress
3) Rewriting the source so that it compiles to Javascript with TeaVM (see 1.8 patch files)
4) Debugging the Javascript version to get rid of any game-breaking bugs.
5) Adding singleplayer? Probably not...

### Compiling
This project does not yet compile for the web, it will work when the above stages have been completed.

To complile to regular desktop Java for quick debugging, see [here](https://github.com/catfoolyou/Eaglercraft-1.12/tree/main)
