# Eaglercraft 1.12 javascript runtime

Dev branch for the Eagler 1.12 javascript runtime. This is still incomplete and does not even compile.

### Things I have to implement:
1) Rewriting Lax1dude's 1.8 code to work with 1.12
2) Patching 1.12 src to work with Lax's code
3) Patching 1.12 to work with Lax's dependencies
4) Upgrading Lax's dependencies to the versions used by stock 1.12

### Compiling
This project does not yet compile for the web, it will work when the above list has been completed.

To complile to regular desktop Java for quick debugging, see [here](https://github.com/catfoolyou/Eaglercraft-1.12/tree/main)
